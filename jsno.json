Reggie provides Vera a public key\n * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\n * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\n * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\n *\n * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\n * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\n * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\n * @dev from the output space.\n *\n * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\n * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\n * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness. It ensures 2 things:\n * @dev 1. The fulfillment came from the VRFCoordinatorV2Plus.\n * @dev 2. The consumer contract implements fulfillRandomWords.\n * *****************************************************************************\n * @dev USAGE\n *\n * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus, and can\n * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus's attributes in their constructor as\n * @dev shown:\n *\n * @dev   contract VRFConsumerV2Plus is VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus {\n * @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _subOwner)\n * @dev       VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus(_vrfCoordinator, _subOwner) public {\n * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\n * @dev       }\n * @dev   }\n *\n * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\n * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash). Create a subscription, fund it\n * @dev and your consumer contract as a consumer of it (see VRFCoordinatorInterface\n * @dev subscription management functions).\n * @dev Call requestRandomWords(keyHash, subId, minimumRequestConfirmations,\n * @dev callbackGasLimit, numWords, extraArgs),\n * @dev see (IVRFCoordinatorV2Plus for a description of the arguments).\n *\n * @dev Once the VRFCoordinatorV2Plus has received and validated the oracle's response\n * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomWords method.\n *\n * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomWords is a set of random words\n * @dev generated from your requestId and the blockHash of the request.\n *\n * @dev If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the\n * @dev requestId returned from requestRandomWords to track which response is associated\n * @dev with which randomness request.\n * @dev See \"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\" for principles to keep in mind,\n * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.\n *\n * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\n * @dev differ.\n *\n * *****************************************************************************\n * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n *\n * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly\n * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that\n * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract\n * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.rawFulfillRandomness method).\n *\n * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free\n * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all\n * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your\n * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\n *\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\n *\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\n * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\n * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\n * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\n * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\n * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).\n */\nabstract contract VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus is IVRFMigratableConsumerV2Plus, ConfirmedOwner {\n  error OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill(address have, address want);\n  error OnlyOwnerOrCoordinator(address have, address owner, address coordinator);\n  error ZeroAddress();\n\n  // s_vrfCoordinator should be used by consumers to make requests to vrfCoordinator\n  // so that coordinator reference is updated after migration\n  IVRFCoordinatorV2Plus public s_vrfCoordinator;\n\n  /**\n   * @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract\n   */\n  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) ConfirmedOwner(msg.sender) {\n    if (_vrfCoordinator == address(0)) {\n      revert ZeroAddress();\n    }\n    s_vrfCoordinator = IVRFCoordinatorV2Plus(_vrfCoordinator);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.
